# Scaling with Azure Application Gateway v2

## Microsoft documentation recap

The AppGW autoscaling SKU (v2) can scale up to **125 instances** (see [App GW limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#application-gateway-limits)).

Each [instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/understanding-pricing#instance-count) can support at least 10 capacity units. The number of capacity unit per instance depends on the application processing requirement (I couldn't find any max value).

A single [capacity unit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/understanding-pricing#capacity-unit) is composed of **1 compute unit + 2500 persistent connections + 2,22 Mbps of throughput**:

- Each [compute unit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/understanding-pricing#compute-unit) supports ~50 connection requests/sec (10 with WAFv2)
- If any of the 3 above parameters (compute unit capacity, # connections, throughput) is exceeded, additional capacity units get triggered, as stated:
